# Specification Quality Checklist: Omaikit - Multi-Agent CLI Toolkit

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: January 14, 2026  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Assessment

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is comprehensive and ready for the planning phase.

### Key Strengths

1. **Clear User Value**: Seven prioritized user stories clearly articulate value with P1 stories forming the MVP
2. **Comprehensive Functional Requirements**: 14 functional requirements cover all major capabilities with specific, testable language
3. **Measurable Success Criteria**: 10 success criteria include specific metrics (5 minutes vs 2-4 hours, 80%+ coverage, 4.0+ satisfaction, 5-10x velocity)
4. **Architecture Quality Standards**: Constitution Alignment sections establish code quality, testing, UX, and performance expectations without implementation details
5. **Edge Cases Identified**: 6 edge cases address ambiguous descriptions, greenfield projects, failures, circular dependencies, cancellation, and unconventional structures
6. **Independent Testability**: Each user story can be tested independently and delivers value on its own
7. **Parallel Execution Opportunities**: Requirements explicitly identify where agents can run in parallel (testing + review)

### Specification Status

✅ **READY FOR PLANNING** - All quality criteria met. The specification is clear, complete, and actionable.

## Notes

No issues requiring remediation. Specification is production-ready for the planning phase.
